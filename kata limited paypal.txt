Dear Dartagnan Ramsey,


We emailed you a little while ago to ask for your help resolving an issue
with your PayPal account. Your account is still temporarily limited because
we haven't heard from you. 

We understand it may be frustrating not to have full access to your PayPal
account. We want to work with you to get your account back to normal as
quickly as possible.

What's the problem?

We noticed some unusual activity in the bank account linked to your PayPal
account.

Case ID Number: PP-006-633-839-859

How you can help

It's usually pretty easy to take care of things like this. Most of the
time, we just need a little more information about your account or latest
transactions.

To help us with this and to see what you can and can't do with your account
until the issue is resolved, log in to your account and go to the
Resolution Center.

Sincerely,
PayPal
