Tips for spamming: 

1. Buy valid targeted & filtered leads for spamming

2. Don't include organisation names like PayPal, Chase etc. on your domain name, from mail list or anywhere

3. Use noip.com to create dns 

4. Always warm up new smtp

5. Don't send mail to gmail, outlook & protonmail to avoid killing your smtp.

6. use s.id to shorten your scampage link.

7. use fresh & clean letter, good smtp & mailer ( heartsender works fine too ) , if your mails keep getting onto
   spam folder then change subject, from mail list sections. Try to avoid spam words on your letter and remember
   your smtp works on reputation so avoid spam mails & warm it up.
